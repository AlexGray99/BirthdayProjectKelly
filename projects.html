            <p>The allure or retro style rail-shooters always held a strong nostalgic following for enthusiasts of the original Star Fox 64, After Burner, Vampire Night, and Panzer Dragoon Orta. The freedom of 3d motion has a charm with varying degrees of difficult spiked by incoming projectiles, and twitch-based reflexes. </p>
            <p>From a developer standpoint: using a central focus prevents excessive environmental development, lending to a more style-oriented experience. Additionally, the construction of a flowing world has similar qualities to a listening to a record (or album), where the listener tags along for a sensory experience as a traveller.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Procedurally generation offers a mixed bag term for videogame archetypes; with some over reliance lending towards rehashing platforms and rooms, creating a stale experience. However, through using procedural generation to create non-central entities – like the scrolling environment in a rail shooter – the core experience can be polished. </p>
            <p>A few weeks ago, I started experimenting with Blender® a freeware 3d modelling program used for sculpting, rendering, and animating digital objects. Whilst this program doesn’t have the strongest in-built game engine it does provide adequate logic brick systems, and python scripting extensions to add customisation. The core concept was to start small and build outward, creating minimalist assets which I eventually turned into 80’s esc wireframe models, reminiscent of a dystopian retro-future sci-fi from that era. Basic zero gravity mechanics incorporated, and with some noodling ~ projectiles and obstacles were crafted to fit the setting. Constructing an ‘empty’ point in 3d space; a landscape-based generator could be set up with timed commands, allowing a handful of environmental templates to move into the players depth of field. There are still some caveats with motion and collision detections, but I’ll find a work around in the coming weeks. </p>
